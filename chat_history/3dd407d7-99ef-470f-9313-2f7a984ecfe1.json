      "content": "Based on your strong interests in programming, hardware, embedded systems, computer architecture, networks, cybersecurity, information systems, software, electronics, power systems, circuits, and electrical systems, along with your academic strengths and career goals, here are the top 3 specific LAU majors that best fit your profile:\n\n**Top 3 Major Recommendations at LAU**\n\n**1. Computer Engineering (COE)**\n   *   **Fit Level:** Excellent (100% match)\n   *   **Why:** This major perfectly aligns with your interests in programming, hardware, embedded systems, computer architecture, networks, and cybersecurity. It directly supports your career goals in Computer Engineering and matches your preferred work environment.\n   *   **Career Paths:** Computer Engineer, Hardware Engineer, Embedded Systems Engineer\n\n**2. Electrical Engineering (ELE)**\n   *   **Fit Level:** Excellent (80% match)\n   *   **Why:** This major strongly aligns with your interests in electronics, power systems, circuits, and electrical systems. It supports your career goals in Electrical Engineering and matches your preferred work environment.\n   *   **Career Paths:** Electrical Engineer, Power Systems Engineer, Electronics Engineer\n\n**3. Applied Physics**\n   *   **Fit Level:** Moderate (33% match)\n   *   **Why:** While not as direct a match as the engineering fields, Applied Physics can provide a strong foundational understanding of many principles relevant to electrical and computer engineering, especially if you are interested in the underlying science of these fields. It supports your career goals and matches your preferred work environment.\n   *   **Career Paths:** Physicist, Research Scientist, Engineer\n\n**Other LAU Majors to Consider:**\n*   **Computer Science:** If your interest leans more heavily towards software development, algorithms, and theoretical computing.\n*   **Bioinformatics:** If you have an interest in applying computational methods to biological data.\n\nI recommend you explore the course maps for Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering to see their detailed curricula. Would you like me to retrieve the course map for any of these majors?"
