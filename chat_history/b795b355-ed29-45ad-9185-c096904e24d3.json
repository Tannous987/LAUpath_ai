Engineering fields often involve a blend of office, field, and lab work, fitting your preferred work environment.\n\n2.  **Architecture** (Fit: Good)\n    *   Match Score: 5/10\n    *   Why: Architecture aligns well with your interests in building, hands-on work, design, problem-solving, and organization. It also offers a mix of studio work, office planning, and site visits, matching your preferred work environment.\n\n3.  **Medicine** (Fit: Moderate)\n    *   Match Score: 3/10\n    *   Why: Medicine aligns with your investigative interests, problem-solving, and science. While it involves hands-on work, it's a different type than construction or mechanics. The work environment is primarily clinical and lab-based.\n\nI encourage you to research these recommended majors in more detail, speak with academic advisors at LAU, and consider taking introductory courses to explore your interests further. You can also use the search tool to find more information about specific engineering programs or architecture at LAU."

      "content": "That's a great follow-up question! Given your interests in building, tools, hands-on work, mechanics, construction, research, analysis, problem-solving, mathematics, science, organization, data, procedures, numbers, and administration, here are a few types of engineering that might be a particularly good fit at LAU:\n\n1.  **Civil Engineering:** This field strongly aligns with your interests in **building, construction, hands-on work, and problem-solving**. Civil engineers design, construct, and maintain infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, buildings, and water systems. This often involves a mix of office design work, field supervision, and analytical problem-solving.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Engineering:** This would be an excellent choice given your interests in **tools, hands-on work, mechanics, and problem-solving**. Mechanical engineers design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. This can range from robotics and automotive systems to power generation and HVAC. It often involves lab work, design, and practical application.\n\n3.  **Computer Engineering / Electrical Engineering:** If your interest in **research, analysis, problem-solving, data, and numbers** leans more towards technology and systems, these fields are very relevant.\n    *   **Computer Engineering** focuses on the design and development of computer hardware and software, often involving hands-on work with circuits, programming, and system integration.\n    *   **Electrical Engineering** deals with electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism, covering areas like power systems, telecommunications, and control systems. Both involve significant lab work, analytical thinking, and problem-solving.\n\n4.  **Industrial Engineering:** Your interests in **organization, data, procedures, numbers, and administration** align well with Industrial Engineering. This field focuses on optimizing complex processes, systems, and organizations. Industrial engineers work to improve efficiency, productivity, and quality in various settings, from manufacturing to healthcare, often involving data analysis and system design in an office or operational environment.\n\nI recommend looking into the specific curricula for these engineering programs at LAU to see which one excites you the most!
